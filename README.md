A simple CRUD operation using Java Spring Boot

Tech used:
1. Java Spring Boot
2. MySQL

This spring Boot application has created to perform CRUD operations. You can use Postman as front-end to insert a data, read, update and delete data. 

You can also use any front-end frameworks (ReactJS, Angular JS) and call this spring boot application as back-end through REST API calls and perform CRUD operations.
